# MathicallJS
A pure-javascript library for mathematics and graphics.

Note that MathicallJS is under the MIT license (see LICENSE for details).

MathicallJS is intended as a standalone javascript library, to allow easy, independent access to many common maths and graphics algorithms. 'Toolbelt' functionalities such as keyboard input monitoring are also included, to support easy integration of maths and graphics into common web applications. 

My own puspose for MathicallJS is to learn, aiming to better understand both javascript and maths/graphics algorithms by coding them myself from the ground up.

## Features
### WIP
* Keyboard and mouse input handling
* Code benchmarking and diagnostics
* Matrix and vector operations
* Basic numeric operations (e.g factorial, gcd)
* Maths parsing and simplification from strings into values or functions
* 2D maths graphing
* Improved 2D canvas manipulation (no WebGL)
* Basic 3D canvas manipulation (no WebGL)
* Versatile colour manipulation
* Inbuilt (optional) webworkers for better performance
* Script loading
* Random number generation
* Basic hashing
* Random noise generation (Perlin, OpenSimplex & Worley noise)
