# MathicallJS
A pure-javascript library for mathematics and graphics.

Note that MathicallJS is under the MIT license (see LICENSE for details).

MathicallJS is intended as a standalone javascript library, to allow easy, independent access to many common maths and graphics algorithms. 'Toolbelt' functionalities, such as keyboard input monitoring, are also included, to support easy integration of maths and graphics into common scenarios. 

My own puspose for MathicallJS is to learn, aiming to better understand both javascript and maths/graphics algorithms by coding them myself from the ground up.
