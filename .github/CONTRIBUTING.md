# Contributing

You're welcome to contribute to MathicallJS by making pull requests to the `dev` branch. Before you begin, make sure you've read both the [README](../README.md) and [Getting started guide](https://github.com/PatGleeson101/mathicall.js/wiki/Getting-started) for background information, and take a look at the [Future development](https://github.com/PatGleeson101/mathicall.js/wiki/Future-development) page for work-in-progress features as well as proposed features that you might like to work on.

As MathicallJS is still at an early stage, keep the following in mind:

- The API structure has two key features (_debugging_ and _cascading options_) which have already been designed but are not yet available to work with.
- The _Developer guide_ has not yet been released; this will provide detailed information to aid with development.
- While the current API structure and workflow of _beta-3.0.0_ is far more stable than in _beta-2.0_, it is still liable to substantial, rapid changes.
