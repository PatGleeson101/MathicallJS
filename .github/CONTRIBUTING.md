# Contributing

You're welcome to contribute to MathicallJS by making pull requests to the `dev` branch. Before you begin, please make sure you've read both the [README](../README.md) and [Getting started guide](https://github.com/PatGleeson101/mathicall.js/wiki/Getting-started) for background information. You can also take a look at the [Future development](https://github.com/PatGleeson101/mathicall.js/wiki/Future-development) page for work-in-progress and proposed features that you might like to work on, although these aren't the only contributions you can make.

The _Developer guide_ has not yet been released; this will provide detailed information to aid with development.
